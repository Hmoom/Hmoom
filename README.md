Salutions! My name is Caleb Davis
I am passionate about developing technology that enhances our human experience.
I am currently embedded software engineer who enjoys creating and modifying a variety of electronic control systems.
Despite challenges and obstacles I have faced along my career path I always seem to find joy in everything I learn along the way.
